# chad-shim-watchdog — host launchd job that supervises chad-shim.py
# inside the chad pod.
#
# Why this exists: chad-shim is the OpenAI-compatible bridge between
# open-webui (the `chad` model) and the openclaw agent. It's a stdlib
# Python HTTP server; if it dies (uncaught BrokenPipeError on a client
# drop, OOM, etc.), open-webui shows "model not found" until something
# restarts it. The only existing recovery path is the once-every-6h
# self-heal block inside chad-backup-to-github — leaves a multi-hour
# window where operators can't chat with chad.
#
# This watchdog matches the chad-gateway-watchdog pattern: probe a
# cheap endpoint (/v1/models), and if it doesn't respond, restart the
# shim. Each restart also writes a structured event to the agent-inbox
# so future chad turns see the incident.
#
# Installed as ~/Library/LaunchAgents/dev.nemoclaw.chad-shim-watchdog.plist.
